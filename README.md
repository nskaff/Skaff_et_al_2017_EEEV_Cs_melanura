These R scripts can be used to re-create the analyses invovled in generating Figures 2,3,4,5,6 from Skaff et al. 2017. 

The data used in this analysis can be found at the following website: https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/#view/doi:10.5063/F1H1303X

Note: The code used to select optimum spatial scales and temporal lags has not been included in these scripts. It may be available in the future.
